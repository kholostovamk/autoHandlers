            The 2023 Chevrolet Colorado gets an update, with new styling, powertrains, and technologies. The exterior features a redesigned grille, front fascia, and LED lighting. The interior also sees a refresh, with a new infotainment system and digital instrument cluster. The base engine is now a 2.5-liter four-cylinder, while a 2.7-liter four-cylinder and a 3.6-liter V-6 are also available. The ZR2 off-road package offers even more capability with features like Multimatic DSSV dampers and skid plates. The new Colorado also includes safety features such as automatic emergency braking and lane-departure warning. However, some reviewers find the new engine options to be underwhelming, and the Colorado's towing capacity is lower than some of its rivals. Overall, the 2023 Chevrolet Colorado offers some improvements over its predecessor, but may not stand out in a competitive midsize truck market.
